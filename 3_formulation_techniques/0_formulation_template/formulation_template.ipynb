    "Besides conciseness and clarity, we want our documentation and code to be as clean and consistent as possible across all use cases. This way we ensure a pleasant experience for the readers, facilitate communication between collaborators and cut down designing time. Therefore, we strongly encourage you to adopt the *4C-approach*.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's true that being clear and concise at the same time can be a challenge. But that's one aspect that often distinguishes great work from the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be consistent, we use in the implementation the exact same notation adopted in the formulation. And we try as much as possible to stick to some conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collection of indices** are denoted with a single capital letters, preferably $I$, $J$, $K$, $L$, and $T$.\n",
    "- **Indices** are denoted with lower case letters and, whenever possible, the same letter of the set it comes from. That way we can be more consise and simply write $\\sum_i x_i$ instead of $\\sum_{i\\in I} x_i$, for example.\n",
    "- **Input parameters** are denoted with lower case letters, making suggestive choices whenever possible. For example, $pc_i$ and $sc_i$ for production cost and storage cost of product $i$, $p_t$ for penalty in period $t$, $sl_j$ and $su_j$ for storage lower and upper bound at location $j$, and $d_t$ for demand in period $t$.\n",
    "- **Decision variables** are denoted with lower case letters, preferably $x$, $y$, $z$, and $w$. If more letters are needed, then we may also use $u$ and $v$. Alternately, we may combine two letters, such as $xa$ and $wb$, where the first letter denotes an already defined decision variable. This way we can easily distinguish decision variables from input parameters when reading a formulation."

When implementing the optimization model in Python, we typically declared set of indices as lists (to preserve the order of its elements and facilitate slicing) and input parameters as dictionaries."
